- 👋 Hi, I’m @xerioc2
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to create games using Unreal Engine 
- 🌱 I’m currently retired from the US Army after 21 years and attending Austin Peay State University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an RPG game idea I have maybe start off 2d and once it has a solid foundation build it into a full fledged 3d third person game
-
-Going to start working on a "Words on Stream" variant but for Magic: The Gathering.  Going to upload files here and document the path I think I will need to go... any help or feedback 
strongly encouraged as I still got around a year and change before I graduate and this is me working solo and never attempting anything like this before.
